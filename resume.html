<!-- There should be a contact info section, with the following information about Sally:
Name
Email address (make one up) as a link
Phone number (make one up)
A picture (feel free to choose one or use this image of Ilana from Broad City) as a stand-in for Sally.
There should be a section for Sally's education, and it should list at least one college she attended.
There should be a section for Sally's employment history, and it should contain at least two entries. Each entry should show the company name, job title, dates of employment, and a short description of the job (for this last bit, feel free to use lorem ipsum filler text). -->
